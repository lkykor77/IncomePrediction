# IncomePrediction
Income prediction model based on U.S. Census dataset

In this project, I am going to make prediction on whether a person's income is above 50k or below 50k using various features such as age, marrital status, occupation, and education. The dataset comes from 1994 US Census on adults, and it can be downloaded in <https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/adult-census-income>.
